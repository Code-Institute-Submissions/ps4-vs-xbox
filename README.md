# PS4 vs Xbox one
I decided to take a look at the differences between, both positive and negative, of the PS4 and the Xbox one. Lots of people debate over which is better but I have found a large amount of bias towards one side or the other in most
of these debates. I decided to take a neutral stance and fully explore each option to give a consumer a guide on which, if either, console is right for them

## UX
 
This website was for a consumer looking to buy a game console but are either undecided on which one is right for them or just simply uninformed on the differences between the two. My site
was set from a neutral viewpoint in order to help them find which product is right for them not me. I combined all of the major
differences between the two consoles in one easy to accsess site.
Back when I was deciding on which one to buy I had a hard time both finding reliable unbiased information as well just differences between the two in general. As a consumer I like to be sure of my purchasing decision
so this lack of easily accessable information forced me to spend much longer than neeeded researching both consoles.

## Features
Comparison of the two consoles.
 
### Existing Features
- General pros and cons - allows comsumers to decide which to examine first and see what each console is known for.
- picture of each - In case they get the two confused allows people to see thr difference in appearance

- final thoughts - gives reasons why you might buy each console and looks at it from multiple perspectives

- I made sure the images were a small enough file size to load fast 
- I made sure my alt text for the images appear if an image dosn't load
- I gave the site to a parent to see what there opinion on buying a console was before amd after
Before: No idea what the differences were just that an xbox game won't work on playstation and viceversa
After: xbox is better for familys or people with a low income because of game pass but if you really want to 
play a certain game on ps4 it is the only option
- small bug in that there is a bit of horizontal scroll no matter how I trry to fix
